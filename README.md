# SOAR EDR Project

## Objective

The SOAR EDR project was geared to design an environment for automatic detection and responses. The primary focus was to create a SOAR playbook using various automation tools, respond to security events as they happen automatically, and perform actions based on user responses to events. This project aimed to gain a deeper understanding of certain processes that could be automated in the real world, create rules and user prompts for detection, and obtain hands-on experience in setting up a SOAR environment.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SOAR concepts and practical application.
- Learned how to create virtual hosts and configure automation software.
- Gained an understanding of how certain components are connected for automation using application channels, sensors, outputs, and webhooks.
- Ability to create detection and response rules for SOAR environment.
- Created a SOAR environment using Tines.
- Configure the process to isolate machines automatically after a security event is detected.
- Ability to send detection and response alerts through emails or to a shared community channel automatically.

### Tools Used
